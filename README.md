# Ruby on Rails featuring Udemy

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to hold all of my work and practice from the
Udemy Ruby on Rails course.

I will be pushing all code that I create for this course to this repository
so that I can keep track of all the work that I have done for the course.
This will enable me to share with friends, family, and future employers the
work that I have completed and the experience that I have gained in Ruby
on Rails.
